============================= Primary Data Extraction using Excel VBA ======================================

# Data needed to be extracted from reports which were created by other departments. These were not in tabular form and each sheet was created for each date. Doing 
  copy paste is tedious work, so below excel module was created. With this if data had been in same cell throughout all sheet, we could extract all data in one go

 Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim outputSheet As Worksheet
    Dim sheetName As String
    Dim rowNum As Integer
    Dim colNum As Integer
    Dim col As Variant

---->Data extracted from these cells

    cols = Array("B2", "C3", "C11", "C7", "C8", "M6", "M5", "C18", "C19", "C20", "F22", "F23", "F24", "F25", "F26", "F27", "F28", "F29", "F30", "F31", "F32", "F33", "F34", "F37", "F38", "F39", "F40", "F43", "F44", "F45")
    
----->New Sheet is created to store data in tabular form

    'Create a new sheet to store the extracted data
    Set outputSheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Add
    outputSheet.Name = "Master"
    
    rowNum = 1
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Sheets
    colNum = 1
    If ws.Name <> outputSheet.Name Then
    sheetName = ws.Name
    For Each col In cols
        outputSheet.Cells(rowNum, 1).Value = sheetName
        outputSheet.Cells(rowNum, colNum + 1).Value = ws.Range(col).Value
        colNum = colNum + 1
        Next col
    rowNum = rowNum + 1
    End If
    Next ws

End Sub

============================= Function for counting no of elements in Column ======================================

    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet2")
    
    ' Specify the column to check
    Set columnToCheck = ws.Columns(col) 
    
    ' Find the last row with data in the specified column
    lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, columnToCheck.Column).End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Get the number of elements (rows) in the column
    GetNumberOfElementsInColumn = lastRow
End Function

============================= Function for counting no of elements in Rows ======================================

   
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet2") ' Change "Sheet2" to your sheet name
    
    ' Specify the column to check
    Set columnToCheck = ws.Columns(rows) ' Change "rows" to your row letter
    
    ' Find the last row with data in the specified column
    lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, columnToCheck.column).End(xlUp).row
    
    ' Get the number of elements (rows) in the column
    GetNumberOfElementsInColumn = lastRow
End Function
